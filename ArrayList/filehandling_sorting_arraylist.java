            The Java Collections Framework (JCF) has interfaces (like List, Set, Map), their implementations (like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap), and some utility classes.

            Collections (note the s) is not a data structure class itself.
            üëâ It is a utility/helper class that contains static methods to operate on collections (like sort(), shuffle(), reverse(), min(), max(), synchronizedList(), etc.).

            So:

            ‚úÖ You are right that JCF has many classes with their own uses/drawbacks.

            ‚ùå But Collections is not like ArrayList or HashSet (which store data).

            ‚úÖ Instead, Collections is like a toolbox of methods you can use on those data structures.

            ‚ÄúCollections Framework has many classes with their own uses and drawbacks. One special class is the Collections utility class, which provides static methods to operate on or return collections.‚Äù
         
            Collection (interface)

            Part of the root hierarchy in JCF.

            Represents a group of objects (like a bag of elements).

            Extended by List, Set, Queue.

            Example:

            Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();


            Collections (class)

            A utility class with only static methods.

            Provides helper methods to work on collections (like sort, reverse, min, max, shuffle).

            Example:

            Collections.sort(list);


            üëâ Easy way to remember:

            Collection = blueprint (interface) for storing data.

            Collections = toolbox (utility class) for working with that data.
