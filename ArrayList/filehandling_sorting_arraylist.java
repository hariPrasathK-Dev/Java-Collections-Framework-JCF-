Generics : 

Note : Most programmers just need to know three things regardng to the Generics :

1) Instantiating a generic class
2) Assigning an instance of a generic class with particular type(class) and then will i be able to assign to that variable, a subclass of that
type(class) ? A question to the 'polymorphism' regaring to the Generics in which a variation to the polymorphism property with regard to the generics.
3) Declaring a method that allows  generic type inputs, will i be able to input a type which is a sub-class of the instantiated type !

 üåü What are Generics?

Generics = a way to write classes, interfaces, and methods that can work with any data type, but still give type safety.
Example:

List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();


Here, List<String> means this list can only hold Strings.

‚úÖ Advantages of Generics (vs. no generics)

Type Safety

Without generics: you could put anything in a collection ‚Üí errors at runtime.

With generics: compiler checks the type ‚Üí errors caught at compile-time.

List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Hari");
names.add(10); // ‚ùå Compile-time error


No Casting Needed

Without generics: you must cast when retrieving.

With generics: automatic type inference.

// Without generics
List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Hari");
String s = (String) list.get(0); // manual cast  

// With generics
List<String> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
list2.add("Hari");
String s2 = list2.get(0); // no cast needed


Code Reusability

You can write one class/method and use it for different types.

class Box<T> {
    T value;
    Box(T value) { this.value = value; }
    T getValue() { return value; }
}
Box<Integer> b1 = new Box<>(100);
Box<String> b2 = new Box<>("Hello");


Better Readability & Maintainability

When you see List<String>, you instantly know it holds Strings, not something else.

üëâ Easy way to remember:

Without Generics = risk of runtime errors + lots of casting.

With Generics = safer, cleaner, reusable code.

/*
 Polymorphism :

 Polymorphism (meaning)

Poly = many, morph = forms ‚Üí ‚Äúone thing, many forms.‚Äù
In Java ‚Üí the same object/ method can behave differently depending on the context.

‚úÖ Types of Polymorphism in Java

Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Same method name, but different parameter list (number/type/order).

Decided at compile time.

class MathUtil {
   int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; }
   double add(double a, double b) { return a+b; }
}


Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

A subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class.

Decided at runtime ‚Üí depends on the actual object being referenced.

class Animal {
   void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
   @Override
   void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
class Cat extends Animal {
   @Override
   void sound() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}
public class Demo {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Animal a = new Dog(); a.sound(); // Bark
       a = new Cat(); a.sound();       // Meow
   }
}

‚úÖ Key Advantages of Polymorphism

Code Reusability ‚Üí write general code, let subclasses specialize.

Flexibility ‚Üí the same method call works differently for different objects.

Readability & Maintainability ‚Üí reduces duplication, makes code cleaner.

Foundation of OOP in Java ‚Üí used everywhere in frameworks like Spring (e.g., beans, interfaces).

üëâ Easy way to remember:

Overloading = compile-time polymorphism (same name, different parameters).

Overriding = runtime polymorphism (same method, different implementation).

public class filehandling_sorting_arraylist {

    // Note : TreeSet data structure is used whenever the data shoudl be sorted and

    // ArrayList is used when the order of the data is a must and then the array

         * You‚Äôre very close, just a small correction üôÇ
         * 
         * The Java Collections Framework (JCF) has interfaces (like List, Set, Map),
         * their implementations (like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap), and some utility
         * classes.
         * 
         * Collections (note the s) is not a data structure class itself.
         * üëâ It is a utility/helper class that contains static methods to operate on
         * collections (like sort(), shuffle(), reverse(), min(), max(),
         * synchronizedList(), etc.).
         * 
         * So:
         * 
         * ‚úÖ You are right that JCF has many classes with their own uses/drawbacks.
         * 
         * ‚ùå But Collections is not like ArrayList or HashSet (which store data).
         * 
         * ‚úÖ Instead, Collections is like a toolbox of methods you can use on those data
         * structures.
         * 
         * ‚ÄúCollections Framework has many classes with their own uses and drawbacks.
         * One special class is the Collections utility class, which provides static
         * methods to operate on or return collections.‚Äù
         * 
         * Collection (interface)
         * 
         * Part of the root hierarchy in JCF.
         * 
         * Represents a group of objects (like a bag of elements).
         * 
         * Extended by List, Set, Queue.
         * 
         * Example:
         * 
         * Collection<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
         * 
         * 
         * Collections (class)
         * 
         * A utility class with only static methods.
         * 
         * Provides helper methods to work on collections (like sort, reverse, min, max,
         * shuffle).
         * 
         * Example:
         * 
         * Collections.sort(list);
         * 
         * 
         * üëâ Easy way to remember:
         * 
         * Collection = blueprint (interface) for storing data.
         * 
         * Collections = toolbox (utility class) for working with that data.
